  <h1>What I Learnt from SQLBolt</h1>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Selecting specific columns from a table</li>
    <li>Filtering rows with <code>WHERE</code></li>
    <li>Using <code>BETWEEN</code>, <code>LIKE</code>, <code>NOT</code>, and <code>OFFSET</code></li>
    <li>Ordering and limiting results</li>
    <li>Performing <code>JOIN</code> operations</li>
    <li>Sorting results based on a column (e.g., rating)</li>
    <li>Handling duplicates with <code>DISTINCT</code></li>
  </ul>
