# MATH and DATE FUNCTION

### Math operators:

- addition (+)
- subtraction (-)
- division (/)
- multiplication (*)
- modulo(% returns the remainder)

#### Math functions:

* ABS(): returns the absolute value of the input expression
* CAST(): converts an expression into another data type

#### Date and time functions:

* DATETIME(): returns the date and time of a time string
* DATE(): returns the date portion of a time string
* TIME(): returns the time portion of a time string
* STRFTIME(): returns a formatted date

#### The following tables contain mock data and can be used for practice,

- <b>bakery</b>: table storing information about orders made at a local bakery
- <b>guesses</b>: table storing the values of a guessing game where the guessed value closest to a number wins

```SQL
SELECT  * 
FROM bakery
LIMIT 5;
```

```SQL
SELECT price * quantity
FROM bakery;
```
* Using the guesses table with the ABS() function, write a query to find out how close each studentâ€™s guess is to the actual number of jelly beans in the jar, which is 804. Select the first name and the absolute difference of each guess from 804.
```SQL
SELECT first_name, ABS(guess - 804)
FROM guesses;
```

* Find out the absolute value of the difference between the average guess of all students from the actual jelly bean count, which is 804

```SQL
SELECT first_name, ABS(AVG(guess) - 804)
FROM guesses;
```
