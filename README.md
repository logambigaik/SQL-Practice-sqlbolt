# SQLBolt Lesson 1 â€“ SELECT Queries 101

This repository contains my completed exercises from [SQLBolt Lesson 1](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_intro).  
It demonstrates foundational SQL querying skills including `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, and more.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Selecting specific columns from a table
- Filtering rows with `WHERE`
- Using `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `NOT`, and `OFFSET`
- Ordering and limiting results
- Performing JOIN operations
- Sorting results based on a column (e.g., rating)
- Handling duplicates with `DISTINCT`
